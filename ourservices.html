                    <p class="card-text mx-2 h6 text-justify">Adventure photography is much more self-explanatory than abstract photography. This type of photography captures images of adventures, usually in the great outdoors. It often features remarkable landscape shots, adventurous travelers,
                        and challenging shooting conditions because of accessibility to particular locations and shifting weather conditions while taking photographs outside. Lugging camera gear into remote, rugged locations provides an additional challenge
                        for adventure photographers. Hiking, biking, backpacking, and camping with gear is something that photographers of this niche genre are very familiar and comfortable with.</p>

                        in a way that is also aesthetically pleasing to the eye. <br> <br> Exterior shots usually use daylight to capture the building along with nearby landscaping features. They can also be shot at night using ambient lighting from street
                        lights, surrounding landscape, or moonlight.Interior shots can be complementary to exterior shots to further depict a particular architectural style or can be used as a standalone.</p>

                    <p class="card-text mx-5 h6">Black and white (B&W) photography focuses on capturing an image with no color. This can either be done through a camera setting or through editing a color image afterward. Monochrome images that use minimal amounts of lighting also
                        fall under this category. <br> <br> When photographic technology first began, almost all images captured were either black and white or varying shades of sepia. Some early color photography was hand-tinted but it was quite rare
                        and expensive to create. As technology advanced into the mid-20th century, color photography became prevalent, taking over the once-dominant B&W genre.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title mx-auto w-100 text-center">COMPOSITE PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
                    <p class="card-text mx-5 h6">Some types of photography are created by combining multiple images to create one composite image. Composite photography requires post-processing and editing of two or more shots to produce a layered shot that still looks cohesive.
                        <br> <br> In the 1880s, way before digital photography and editing existed, composite portraiture was being produced using a technique that allowed multiple exposures to be taken on the same photographic plate. These days though,
                        separate images are blended by using layers, masks, and blurs. Montages of photos, where a scene is photographed in small chunks and then combined, and multiplicity, in which a person is captured multiple times in the same scene,
                        can also create a composite photograph. Focus stacking, where a scene is captured from different angles or points of focus and then blended into one, is another technique used to create a large depth of field.</p>

                    <p class="card-text mx-5 h6">Taking photos of a family in posed or candid portraiture is known as family photography. These types of shots are often commissioned by the family for personal use to hang in the family home. They capture the relationships between
                        parents, children, siblings, and sometimes extended family. Family reunions, weddings, and other family occasions are an ideal opportunity to practice this type of photography. Newborn photography and shooting events like cake
                        smashes can also fall under this genre.
                        <br> <br> When used commercially, capturing family photos should feel authentic and real. Similar to candid photography, these images can show the connection and tender moments caught between family members or they can emulate
                        a staged family photoshoot. Paramount, however, is that the models hired either are actual family or are able to communicate the intimacy associated with family. Otherwise, you can end up with an awkward group of models pretending
                        to family.</p>

                    <p class="card-text mx-5 h6">Wedding photography can include engagement photos, pre-wedding photos, shots taken during the ceremony or reception on the big day itself, as sometimes may even include honeymoon or “trash the dress” photos. Wedding photography is
                        also one of the larger categories of commercial photography, with many photographers specializing in this service.
                        <br> <br> There are two main approaches to wedding photography: traditional or photojournalistic. The traditional approach typically has posed images that the photographer controls and directs throughout the event. The photojournalistic
                        approach usually has a more editorial feel, with candid, more natural images taken using little direction. A third, more fashion-focused approach also exists, with these shots using more innovative or creative techniques, delivering
                        more dramatic imagery. Culture and tradition often play a large part in the style and types of shots a couple is looking to capture.</p>

                    <p class="card-text mx-5 h6">Taking photographs while underwater, usually while scuba diving, snorkeling, swimming, or from an underwater vehicle or automated camera lowered from the surface, is known as underwater photography. This type of photography results
                        in images of marine life, the subaquatic environment (including shipwrecks, geological features such as cave systems and other underwater-scapes), and/or people pursuing underwater activities. More recently, underwater imagery
                        has also been used to document the state of bodies of water and their ecosystems when it comes to issues of climate change and pollution.
                        <br> <br> Equipment is an important aspect of this genre as cameras tend not to be waterproof by default. If they are, they are usually limited to a particular depth. GoPros or smartphones in plastic pouches are sometimes used
                        as a gateway into underwater photography before investing in more advanced camera equipment and proper, often expensive, underwater housing for a particular camera.</p>

                    <p class="card-text mx-5 h6">All photos taken at night fall under the category of night photography. Camera settings must be adjusted and sometimes special techniques are used in order to capture images in these low lit conditions.Long exposures and time-lapses
                        are popular techniques, as is light painting and spiral photography. Astrophotography and Milky Way photography can belong to this genre of photography as well.
                        <br> <br> Besides capturing the night sky, other common subject matter in night photography includes city skylines, industrial scenes and factories, fireworks, nightlife or live concerts, roads, lit caves, abandoned buildings or
                        bodies of water lit by moonlight, lighting, lava, aurora borealis or aurora australis, amusement park rides, lit aircraft, bioluminescence, and other creative sources of light.</p>

                    <p class="card-text mx-5 h6">Belonging to commercial photography, product photography focuses on capturing objects for advertising purposes. Catalogues, brochures, and websites all use product photography to show their goods.
                        <br> <br> With e-commerce continuing to grow as a platform and the internet providing a much faster way for people to bring their goods to market, even the world of fashion photography is incorporating techniques that no longer
                        require human models. Clean product photography that features the product on a white background, techniques like knolling (where objects are arranged in an organized, eye-pleasing way and shot as creative ads), and ghost mannequin
                        photography, where mannequins are used and then edited out of the final shot, are just some of the recent trends in product photography.</p>
